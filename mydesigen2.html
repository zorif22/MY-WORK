<h1><font color="blue">Whats is Devops</h1></font>
<p>DevOps methodology focuses on better collaboration between the Development team and the Operations team. So, DevOps engineers are individuals who oversee the entire software development lifecycle. They are instrumental in handling the code releases, implementing CI/CD pipeline, automating various processes, and solving any issues that arise during the development, deployment, or maintenance phase. </p>

<h2><font color="blue">How does DevOps work?</font></h2>
<p>A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. It’s a new way of working, a cultural shift, that has significant implications for teams and the organizations they work for.Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams merge into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle — from development and test to deployment and operations — and have a range of multidisciplinary skills.</p>
<p>DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, which helps to increase reliability. A DevOps toolchain helps teams tackle important DevOps fundamentals including continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration.</p>
<p>evOps values are sometimes applied to teams other than development. When security teams adopt a DevOps approach, security is an active and integrated part of the development process. This is called DevSecOps.</p>
<h2><font color="blue"> Why become Devops Engineer? </font></h2>
<p>DevOps Engineer topped the list of LinkedIn’s Emerging Jobs of 2020 India report. DevOps along with Agile is helping businesses increase their productivity, reduce the time to market for their products, and better Return on Investment (ROI). Evidently, more companies are willing to adopt DevOps practices and tools making DevOps Engineer a highly sought-after role.</p>
<h2> <font color="blue">The DevOps lifecycle</h2></font>
<p>Because of the continuous nature of DevOps, practitioners use the infinity loop to show how the phases of the DevOps lifecycle relate to each other. Despite appearing to flow sequentially, the loop symbolizes the need for constant collaboration and iterative improvement throughout the entire lifecycle.</p>
